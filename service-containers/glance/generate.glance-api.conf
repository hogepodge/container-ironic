# The driver to use for image cache management.
#
# This configuration option provides the flexibility to choose between the

# for providing the essential functions of image-cache like write images to/read
# images from cache, track age and usage of cached images, provide a list of
# cached images, fetch size of the cache, queue images for caching and clean up
# the cache, etc.
#
# The essential functions of a driver are defined in the base class
# ''glance.image_cache.drivers.base.Driver''. All image-cache drivers (existing
# and prospective) must implement this interface. Currently available drivers
# are ''sqlite'' and ''xattr''. These drivers primarily differ in the way they
# store the information about cached images:
#     * The ''sqlite'' driver uses a sqlite database (which sits on every glance
#     node locally) to track the usage of cached images.
#     * The ''xattr'' driver uses the extended attributes of files to store this
#     information. It also requires a filesystem that sets ''atime'' on the
# files
#     when accessed.

#
# NOTE: This is just a threshold for cache-pruner to act upon. It is NOT a

# on how often the cache-pruner runs and how quickly the cache fills, the image
# cache can far exceed the size specified here very easily. Hence, care must be
# taken to appropriately schedule the cache-pruner and in setting this limit.
#
# Glance caches an image when it is downloaded. Consequently, the size of the
# image cache grows over time as the number of downloads increases. To keep the
# cache size from becoming unmanageable, it is recommended to run the
# cache-pruner as a periodic task. When the cache pruner is kicked off, it
# compares the current size of image cache and triggers a cleanup if the image
# cache grew beyond the size specified here. After the cleanup, the size of
# cache is less than or equal to size specified here.

# This is the location where image data is cached and served out of. All cached
# images are stored directly under this directory. This directory also contains
# three subdirectories, namely, ''incomplete'', ''invalid'' and ''queue''.
#
# The ''incomplete'' subdirectory is the staging area for downloading images. An
# image is first downloaded to this directory. When the image download is
# successful it is moved to the base directory. However, if the download fails,
# the partially downloaded image file is moved to the ''invalid'' subdirectory.
#
# The ''queue''subdirectory is used for queuing images for download. This is
# used primarily by the cache-prefetcher, which can be scheduled as a periodic
# task like cache-pruner and cache-cleaner, to cache images ahead of their
# usage.
# Upon receiving the request to cache an image, Glance touches a file in the
# ''queue'' directory with the image id as the file name. The cache-prefetcher,
# when running, polls for the files in ''queue'' directory and starts
# downloading them in the order they were created. When the download is
# successful, the zero-sized file is deleted from the ''queue'' directory.

#
# Enables SQL requests profiling in services. Default value is False (SQL
# requests won't be traced).
#
# Possible values:
#
# * True: Enables SQL requests profiling. Each SQL query will be part of the
# trace and can the be analyzed by how much time was spent for that.

# the REST API has to set one of these keys in the headers of the REST API call
# to include profiling results of this node for this particular project.
#
# Both "enabled" flag and "hmac_keys" config options should be set to enable
# profiling. Also, to generate correct profiling information across all services

#
# From glance.api

#
# Preference order of storage backends.
#
# Provide a comma separated list of store names in the order in

# These store names must be registered with the ''stores''
# configuration option.
#
# NOTE: The ''store_type_preference'' configuration option is applied
# only if ''store_type'' is chosen as a value for the
# ''location_strategy'' configuration option. An empty list will not
# change the location order.
#
# Possible values:

# Task executor to be used to run task scripts.

# Provide a string value representing the executor to use for task
# executions. By default, ''TaskFlow'' executor is used.
#
# ''TaskFlow'' helps make task executions easy, consistent, scalable
# and reliable. It also enables creation of lightweight task objects

# declarative manner.

#
# Absolute path to the work directory to use for asynchronous
# task operations.
#
# The directory set here will be used to operate over images -
# normally before they are imported in the destination store.
#
# NOTE: When providing a value for ''work_dir'', please make sure
# that enough space is provided for concurrent tasks to run
# efficiently without running out of space.
#
# A rough estimation can be done by multiplying the number of
# ''max_workers'' with an average image size (e.g 500MB). The image
# size estimation should be done based on the average size in your
# deployment. Note that depending on the tasks running you may need
# to multiply this number by some factor depending on what the task
# does. For example, you may want to double the available size if
# image conversion is enabled. All this being said, remember these
# are just estimations and you should do them based on the worst
# case scenario and be prepared to act in case they were wrong.

# Possible values:
#     * String value representing the absolute path to the working
#       directory

# Related Options:

[taskflow_executor]

#
# From glance.api
#

#
# Set the taskflow engine mode.
#
# Provide a string type value to set the mode in which the taskflow
# engine would schedule tasks to the workers on the hosts. Based on
# this mode, the engine executes tasks either in single or multiple
# threads. The possible values for this configuration option are:
# ''serial'' and ''parallel''. When set to ''serial'', the engine runs
# all the tasks in a single thread which results in serial execution
# of tasks. Setting this to ''parallel'' makes the engine run tasks in
# multiple threads. This results in parallel execution of tasks.
#
# Possible values:
#     * serial
#     * parallel
#
# Related options:
#     * max_workers
#
#  (string value)
# Allowed values: serial, parallel
#engine_mode = parallel

#
# Set the number of engine executable tasks.
#
# Provide an integer value to limit the number of workers that can be
# instantiated on the hosts. In other words, this number defines the
# number of parallel tasks that can be executed at the same time by
# the taskflow engine. This value can be greater than one when the
# engine mode is set to parallel.
#
# Possible values:
#     * Integer value greater than or equal to 1

# Related options:

#
# Set the desired image conversion format.
#
# Provide a valid image format to which you want images to be
# converted before they are stored for consumption by Glance.
# Appropriate image format conversions are desirable for specific
# storage backends in order to facilitate efficient handling of
# bandwidth and usage of the storage infrastructure.
#
# By default, ''conversion_format'' is not set and must be set
# explicitly in the configuration file.
#
# The allowed values for this option are ''raw'', ''qcow2'' and
# ''vmdk''. The  ''raw'' format is the unstructured disk format and
# should be chosen when RBD or Ceph storage backends are used for
# image storage. ''qcow2'' is supported by the QEMU emulator that
# expands dynamically and supports Copy on Write. The ''vmdk'' is
# another common disk format supported by many common virtual machine
# monitors like VMWare Workstation.
#
# Possible values:
#     * qcow2
#     * raw
#     * vmdk
#
# Related options:
